# website_example
This is an Example of my Website.
It responsive to different size variations: iPhone X, iPad and Desktop PC.
You can view the Demo here: https://pchitantawebsite.netlify.app/

Due to this being a short demo, lorem ipsum was used to fill the paragraphs. I intent to finish this project since I actually want to make a blog/website about the topic mentiond in the Title.

I am aware of Frameworks like Bootstrap, React, Angular, Vue.js, etc. 
  I know that it is easier to create websites using Frameworks. My intent behind using HTML without frameworks is to learn the language from scratch.
  My next objective is to learn how to operate the Bootstrap Framework.
